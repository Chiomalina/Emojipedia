# Emojipedia Project

This project is a simple React application that displays a list of emojis along with their names and meanings. The emojis are displayed dynamically from a predefined data source, called `Emojipedia`.

## Features

- **React-based Application**: The app is built using React, using state and props to manage and display emoji data.
- **Mapping through Data**: The emojis and their details are rendered by mapping through an array of objects (`emojipedia.js`).
- **Reusable Components**: The `Emojis` component is reusable to display each emoji's information, and the `App` component maps the data into the `Emojis` component.
- **Accessible Design**: Emojis have accessible `aria-label` attributes for better screen reader compatibility.
